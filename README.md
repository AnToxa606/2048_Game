2048 is a popular single-player sliding puzzle game created by Gabriele Cirulli in 2014. 
Played on a 4x4 grid, players swipe tiles up, down, left, or right to combine matching numbers (like two 2s into a 4, two 4s into an 8, and so on). 
A new tile (usually 2 or 4) spawns randomly after each move. The goal is to reach a 2048 tile without filling the board. Simple yet addictive!
